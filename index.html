  USGIN: The U.S. Geoscience Information Network</span><strong><br/>
  A distributed,  interoperable data network for the geosciences</strong></span><br/><br/></div>

      A partnership of the Association of American State Geologists (AASG - state geological surveys) and the U.S.  Geological Survey (USGS) formally agreed in 2007 to develop a national geoscience information framework  that is distributed, interoperable, uses open source standards and common  protocols, respects and acknowledges data ownership, fosters communities of  practice to grow, and develops new web services and clients. The AASG and USGS  have formed an interagency  Steering Committee to pursue design and implementation of the U.S. Geoscience  Information Network (USGIN). </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">The USGIN  project will develop standardized services to make data resources of the state and federal geological surveys accessible online  in a distributed network using a few standards and protocols, and work with  data providers to implement these services.     The network is open to all providers and users.  We hope it will become  a core component of the emerging cyberinfrastructure for the Earth  sciences.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">http://lab.usgin.org [Dead Link, http://lab.usgin.org]The key components of this network are 1) catalog systems  for data discovery; 2) service definitions that define interfaces for searching  catalogs and accessing resources; 3) shared interchange formats to encode  information for transmission (e.g. various XML markup languages); 4) data  providers that publish information using standardized services defined by the  network; and 5) client applications enabled to utilize information resources  provided by the network. The USGIN will integrate and utilize catalog resources  that currently exist or are in development. We are working closely with the  USGS National Geologic Map Database, which has an existing map catalog,  and with the USGS National Geological and  Geophysical Data Preservation project, which is developing a metadata catalog  for geoscience information resource discovery. The GEON catalog is another  existing catalog resource we hope to integrate. Existing data formats such as  GeoSciML, ChemML, and Open Geospatial Consortium sensor, observation and  measurement MLs will provide the necessary interchange formats. Client  application development will be fostered by collaboration with industry  partners such as ESRI. The USGIN project will focus on the remaining aspects of  the system -- service definitions and assistance data providers to implement  the services and bring content online &#8211; and on system integration.  </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">USGIN and partners will receive about $625,000 from NSF under the INTEROP initiative to start building the data network. The U.S. Geosciences Information Network project will be managed by the Arizona Geological Survey on behalf of the Association of American State Geologists (AASG) in partnership with the USGS.   In addition to <a href="http://www.geongrid.org/">GEON</a>, the <a href="http://www.earthchem.org/">Earthchem</a> network is an active  partner.   Collaborators include GIS  software company ESRI, and the OneGeology consortium of 80 nations that is  building a global digital geologic map.  </p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">OneGeology and USGIN have agreed to integrate their networks,  effectively setting global standards among geological surveys that could spread  across the entire field.  Work is in  progress to build an ESRI geodatabase Geology Data Model for ArcGIS software to  be compatible with USGIN, and other companies are expressing interest in adapting  their services, applications, and clients to take advantage of the vast data  resources expected to make become available through USGIN.</p>
